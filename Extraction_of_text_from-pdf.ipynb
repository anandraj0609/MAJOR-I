       "'Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction\\nBack to Introduction --  Index --  Chapter 2 \\nChapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction\\nLet us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the essential elements of the language in real \\nprograms, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. At this point, we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the examples are meant to be correct). We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output. We are intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger programs. These include pointers, structures, most of C\\'s rich set of operators, several control-flow statements, and the standard library. \\nThis approach and its drawbacks. Most notable is that the complete story on any particular feature is not found \\nhere, and the tutorial, by being brief, may also be misleading. And because the examples do not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as they might be. We have tried to minimize these effects, but be warned. Another drawback is that later chapters will necessarily repeat some of this chapter. We hope that the repetition will help you more than it annoys. \\nIn any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in this chapter to their own \\nprogramming needs. Beginners should supplement it by writing small, similar programs of their own. Both groups can use it as a framework on which to hang the more detailed descriptions that begin in \\nChapter 2. \\n1.1 Getting Started\\nThe only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words\\n hello, world \\nThis is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it \\nsuccessfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy. \\nIn C, the program to print ``hello, world\\'\\' is    #include <stdio.h>\\n   main()\\n   {     printf(\"hello, world\\\\n\");\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x001\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

       "'Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction\\n   }\\nJus how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating \\nsystem you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``.c\\'\\', such as hello.c, then compile it with \\nthe command \\n   cc hello.c\\nIf you haven\\'t botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will \\nproceed silently, and make an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out by typing the command \\n   a.out\\nit will print \\n   hello, world\\nOn other systems, the rules will be different; check with a local expert. \\nNow, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever its size, consists of functions and \\nvariables. A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the procedures \\nand functions of Pascal. Our example is a function named main. Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but ``main\\'\\' is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere. \\nmain will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others from libraries that \\nare provided for you. The first line of the program, \\n   #include <stdio.h>\\ntells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library; the line appears at the beginning \\nof many C source files. The standard library is described in \\nChapter 7 and Appendix B. \\nOne method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called arguments, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this \\nexample, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ). \\n#include <stdio.h>                 include information about standard library\\nmain()                                          define a function called main                                             that received no argument values{                                   statements of main are enclosed in braces    printf(\"hello, world\\\\n\");              main calls library function printf\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x002\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

The function main contains only one statement, \\n   printf(\"hello, world\\\\n\");\\nA function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the function printf \\nwith the argument \"hello, world\\\\n\". printf is a library function that prints output, in this case the string \\nof characters between the quotes. \\nA sequence of characters in double quotes, like \"hello, world\\\\n\", is called a character string or string \\nconstant. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions. \\nThe sequence \\\\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, which when printed advances the output to \\nthe left margin on the next line. If you leave out the \\\\n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \\\\n to include a newline character in the printf argument; \\nif you try something like \\n   printf(\"hello, world\\n   \");\\nthe C compiler will produce an error message. \\nprintf never supplies a newline character automatically, so several calls may be used to build up an output line \\nin stages.

An escape sequence like \\\\n provides a general and extensible \\nmechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters.

There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates. \\nThe body of a while can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature converter, or a \\nsingle statement without braces, as in \\n   while (i < j)\\n       i = 2 * i;\\nIn either case, we will always indent the statements controlled by the while by one tab stop (which we have \\nshown as four spaces) so you can see at a glance which statements are inside the loop. The indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program. Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently. \\nMost of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius temperature is computed and assigned to the \\nvariable celsius by the statement \\n        celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;\\nThe reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other \\nlanguages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be \\ntruncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero. \\nThis example also shows a bit more of how printf works. printf is a general-purpose output formatting \\nfunction, which we will describe in detail in \\nChapter 7. Its first argument is a string of characters to be printed, \\nwith each % indicating where one of the other (second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it \\nis to be printed. For instance, %d specifies an integer argument, so the statement \\n        printf(\"%d\\\\t%d\\\\n\", fahr, celsius);\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x006\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

The behaviour of \\nprintf is defined in the ANSI standard, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and \\nlibrary that conforms to the standard. \\nIn order to concentrate on C itself, we don\\'t talk much about input and output until chapter 7. In particular, we will \\ndefer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of the function scanf in \\nSection 7.4. scanf is like printf, except that it reads input instead of writing output. \\nThere are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn\\'t \\nvery pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That\\'s easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf \\nstatement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say \\n   printf(\"%3d %6d\\\\n\", fahr, celsius);\\nto print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide, like this: \\n     0     -17\\n    20      -6    40       4    60      15    80      26   100      37   ...\\nThe more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very \\naccurate; for instance, 0\\noF is actually about -17.8oC, not -17. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-\\npoint arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program.

It's bad practice to bury ``magic numbers'' like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey little information to someone who might have to read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. One way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful \\nnames.

Symbolic constant names are conventionally written in upper case so they can ber readily \\ndistinguished from lower case variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a #define line. \\n1.5 Character Input and Output\\nWe are going to consider a family of related programs for processing character data. You will find that many \\nprograms are just expanded versions of the prototypes that we discuss here. \\nThe model of input and output supported by the standard library is very simple. Text input or output, regardless of \\nwhere it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. It is the responsibility of the library to make each input or output stream confirm this model; the C programmer using the library need not worry about how lines are represented outside the program. \\nThe standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one character at a time, of which getchar \\nand putchar are the simplest. Each time it is called, getchar reads the next input character from a text stream \\nand returns that as its value. That is, after \\n   c = getchar();\\nthe variable c contains the next character of input. The characters normally come from the keyboard; input from \\nfiles is discussed in \\nChapter 7. \\nThe function putchar prints a character each time it is called: \\n   putchar(c);\\nprints the contents of the integer variable c as a character, usually on the screen. Calls to putchar and printf \\nmay be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made. \\n1.5.1 File Copying\\nGiven getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time: \\nread a character\\n    while (charater is not end-of-file indicator)\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course, like everything else, stored internally just as \\na bit pattern. The type char is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. We used int for a subtle but important reason. \\nThe problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive \\nvalue when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called \\nEOF, for ``end of file''. We must declare c to be a type big enough to hold any value that getchar returns. We can't use char since c must be big enough to hold EOF in addition to any possible char. Therefore we use int. \\nEOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>, but the specific numeric value doesn't matter as long as it is not the same as \\nany char value. By using the symbolic constant, we are assured that nothing in the program depends on the \\nspecific numeric value. \\nThe program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment, \\nsuch as \\n   c = getchar();\\nis an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. This means that a \\nassignment can appear as part of a larger expression. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way: \\n   #include <stdio.h>\\n   /* copy input to output; 2nd version  */\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x001\\x002\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]\""

You could instead write nc = nc + 1 but ++nc is \\nmore concise and often more efficient. There is a corresponding operator -- to decrement by 1. The operators ++ and -- can be either prefix operators (++nc) or postfix operators (nc++); these two forms have different values in expressions, as will be shown in \\nChapter 2, but ++nc and nc++ both increment nc. For the moment we will will \\nstick to the prefix form. \\nThe character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int. long integers are at \\nleast 32 bits. Although on some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767, and it would take relatively little input to overflow an int counter.

We put it on a separate line to make it visible. \\nBefore we leave the character counting program, observe that if the input contains no characters, the while or \\nfor test fails on the very first call to getchar, and the program produces zero, the right answer. This is important. One of the nice things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding \\nwith the body.

As we mentioned above, the standard library ensures that an input text stream \\nappears as a sequence of lines, each terminated by a newline. Hence, counting lines is just counting newlines: \\n   #include <stdio.h>\\n   /* count lines in input */\\n   main()   {       int c, nl;\\n       nl = 0;\\n       while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)           if (c == \\'\\\\n\\')               ++nl;       printf(\"%d\\\\n\", nl);   }\\nThe body of the while now consists of an if, which in turn controls the increment ++nl. The if statement tests \\nthe parenthesized condition, and if the condition is true, executes the statement (or group of statements in braces) that follows. We have again indented to show what is controlled by what. \\nThe double equals sign == is the C notation for ``is equal to\\'\\' (like Pascal\\'s single = or Fortran\\'s .EQ.). This \\nsymbol is used to distinguish the equality test from the single = that C uses for assignment. A word of caution: newcomers to C occasionally write = when they mean ==. As we will see in \\nChapter 2, the result is usually a legal \\nexpression, so you will get no warning. \\nA character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character \\nin the machine\\'s character set. This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small \\ninteger. So, for example, \\'A\\' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the internal representation of the character A. Of course, \\'A\\' is to be preferred over 65: its meaning is obvious, and it is \\nindependent of a particular character set. \\nThe escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constants, so \\'\\\\n\\' stands for the value of \\nthe newline character, which is 10 in ASCII. You should note carefully that \\'\\\\n\\' is a single character, and in expressions is just an integer; on the other hand, \\'\\\\n\\' is a string constant that happens to contain only one \\ncharacter. The topic of strings versus characters is discussed further in \\nChapter 2. \\nExercise 1-8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. \\nExercise 1-9.

It is easy to draw the \\nhistogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. \\nExercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input. \\n1.7 Functions\\nIn C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran, or a procedure or function in Pascal. A \\nfunction provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation, which can then be used without worrying about its implementation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient. C makes the sue of functions easy, convinient and efficient; you will often see a short function defined and called only once, just because it clarifies some piece of code. \\nSo far we have used only functions like printf, getchar and putchar that have been provided for us; now \\nit\\'s time to write a few of our own. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definition by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it \\nhandles only positive powers of small integers, but it\\'s good enough for illustration.(The standard library contains a \\nfunction pow(x,y) that computes x\\ny.) \\nHere is the function power and a main program to exercise it, so you can see the whole structure at once. \\n   #include <stdio.h>\\n   int power(int m, int n);    /* test power function */\\n    main()    {        int i;\\n        for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\\n            printf(\"%d %d %d\\\\n\", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));        return 0;    }\\n    /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */\\n    int power(int base, int n)    {        int i,  p;\\n        p = 1;\\n        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)            p = p * base;        return p;    }\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x002\\x000\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

If the source program appears in several files, you may have to say more to compile and load it than if it all appears in one, but that is an operating system matter, not a language attribute. For the moment, we will assume that both functions are in the same file, so whatever you have learned about running C programs will still work. \\nThe function power is called twice by main, in the line    printf(\"%d %d %d\\\\n\", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));\\nEach call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an \\nexpression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are.

The names used by \\npower for its parameters are local to power, and are not visible to any other function: other routines can use the same names without conflict.

In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main \\nfunctions up to this point, but we will include them hereafter, as a reminder that programs should return status to their environment. \\nThe declaration \\n    int power(int base, int n);\\njust before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This \\ndeclaration, which is called a function prototype, has to agree with the definition and uses of power. It is an error \\nif the definition of a function or any uses of it do not agree with its prototype. \\nparameter names need not agree. Indeed, parameter names are optional in a function prototype, so for the prototype \\nwe could have written \\n    int power(int, int);\\nWell-chosen names are good documentation however, so we will often use them. \\nA note of history: the biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and \\ndefined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this: \\n   /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */\\n   /*         (old-style version) */   power(base, n)   int base, n;   {       int i, p;\\n       p = 1;\\n       for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)           p = p * base;       return p;   }\\nThe parameters are named between the parentheses, and their types are declared before opening the left brace; \\nundeclared parameters are taken as int. (The body of the function is the same as before.) \\nThe declaration of power at the beginning of the program would have looked like this:     int power();\\nNo parameter list was permitted, so the compiler could not readily check that power was being called correctly. \\nIndeed, since by default power would have been assumed to return an int, the entire declaration might well have \\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x002\\x002\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]'"

The old style of declaration and definition still works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period, but we strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it. \\nExercise 1.15. Rewrite the temperature conversion program of \\nSection 1.2 to use a function for conversion. \\n1.8 Arguments - Call by Value\\nOne aspect of C functions may be unfamiliar to programmers who are used to some other languages, particulary \\nFortran. In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value.'' This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to some different properties than are \\nseen with ``call by reference'' languages like Fortran or with var parameters in Pascal, in which the called routine \\nhas access to the original argument, not a local copy. \\nCall by value is an asset, however, not a liability. It usually leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous \\nvariables, because parameters can be treated as conveniently initialized local variables in the called routine. For \\nexample, here is a version of power that makes use of this property. \\n   /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0; version 2 */\\n   int power(int base, int n)   {       int p;\\n       for (p = 1; n > 0; --n)\\n           p = p * base;       return p;   }\\nThe parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it \\nbecomes zero; there is no longer a need for the variable i. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with. \\nWhen necessary, it is possible to arrange for a function to modify a variable in a calling routine. The caller must \\nprovide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable), and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the variable indirectly through it. We will cover pointers in \\nChapter 5. \\nThe story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the \\nfunction is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument of the array. This is the topic of the next section. \\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x002\\x003\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]\""

       "\"Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction\\n1.9 Character Arrays\\nThe most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays and \\nfunctions to manipulate them, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. The outline is simple enough: \\n   while (there's another line)\\n       if (it's longer than the previous longest)           (save it)           (save its length)   print longest line\\nThis outline makes it clear that the program divides naturally into pieces. One piece gets a new line, another saves \\nit, and the rest controls the process. \\nSince things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too. Accordingly, let us first write a separate \\nfunction getline to fetch the next line of input. We will try to make the function useful in other contexts. At the minimum, getline has to return a signal about possible end of file; a more useful design would be to return the \\nlength of the line, or zero if end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid line length. Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing only a newline has length 1. \\nWhen we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a \\nsecond function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. \\nFinally, we need a main program to control getline and copy. Here is the result.    #include <stdio.h>\\n   #define MAXLINE 1000   /* maximum input line length */\\n   int getline(char line[], int maxline);\\n   void copy(char to[], char from[]);\\n   /* print the longest input line */\\n   main()   {       int len;            /* current line length */       int max;            /* maximum length seen so far */       char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */       char longest[MAXLINE]; /* longest line saved here */\\n       max = 0;\\n       while ((len = getline(line, MAXLINE)) > 0)           if (len > max) {               max = len;               copy(longest, line);           }\\n\\x00h\\x00t\\x00t\\x00p\\x00:\\x00/\\x00/\\x00f\\x00r\\x00e\\x00e\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00s\\x00.\\x00b\\x00y\\x00.\\x00r\\x00u\\x00/\\x00v\\x00i\\x00e\\x00w\\x00/\\x00C\\x00P\\x00r\\x00o\\x00g\\x00r\\x00a\\x00m\\x00m\\x00i\\x00n\\x00g\\x00L\\x00a\\x00n\\x00g\\x00u\\x00a\\x00g\\x00e\\x00/\\x00c\\x00h\\x00a\\x00p\\x00t\\x00e\\x00r\\x001\\x00.\\x00h\\x00t\\x00m\\x00l\\x00 \\x00(\\x002\\x004\\x00 \\x00o\\x00f\\x00 \\x003\\x000\\x00)\\x00 \\x00[\\x009\\x00/\\x006\\x00/\\x002\\x000\\x000\\x002\\x00 \\x001\\x002\\x00:\\x002\\x001\\x00:\\x001\\x001\\x00 \\x00]\""

The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. \\nSome functions return a useful value; others, like copy, are used only for their effect and return no value.

This conversion is also used by the C language: when a string constant \\nlike \\n   \"hello\\\\n\"\\nappears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated \\nwith a \\'\\\\0\\' to mark the end. \\n \\nThe %s format specification in printf expects the corresponding argument to be a string represented in this form. copy also relies on the fact that its input argument is terminated with a \\'\\\\0\\', and copies this character into \\nthe output. \\nIt is worth mentioning in passing that even a program as small as this one presents some sticky design problems. \\nFor example, what should main do if it encounters a line which is bigger than its limit? getline works safely, \\nin that it stops collecting when the array is full, even if no newline has been seen. By testing the length and the last \\ncharacter returned, main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. In the interests \\nof brevity, we have ignored this issue. \\nThere is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks \\nfor overflow. On the other hand, the user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are, so we \\nhave chosen not to add error checking to it. \\nExercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrary \\nlong input lines, and as much as possible of the text. \\nExercise 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters. Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely \\nblank lines. \\nExercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that \\nreverses its input a line at a time. \\n1.10 External Variables and Scope\\nThe variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared \\nwithin main, no other function can have direct access to them. The same is true of the variables in other functions; for example, the variable i in getline is unrelated to the i in copy. Each local variable in a function comes into \\nexistence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. This is why such variables are usually known as automatic variables, following terminology in other languages.

( Chapter 4 discusses the static storage class, in which \\nlocal variables do retain their values between calls.) \\nBecause automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to \\nthe next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. If they are not set, they will contain garbage. \\nAs an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions, that is, \\nvariables that can be accessed by name by any function. (This mechanism is rather like Fortran COMMON or Pascal variables declared in the outermost block.) Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. Furthermore, because external variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned. \\nAn external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside storage for it. The \\nvariable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable. The \\ndeclaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be implicit from context.

       "\"Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction\\nSince the specialized versions of getline and copy have no arguments, logic would suggest that their \\nprototypes at the beginning of the file should be getline() and copy(). But for compatibility with older C \\nprograms the standard takes an empty list as an old-style declaration, and turns off all argument list checking; the \\nword void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4. \\nYou should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we refer to external \\nvariables in this section.``Definition'' refers to the place where the variable is created or assigned storage; ``declaration'' refers to places where the nature of the variable is stated but no storage is allocated. \\nBy the way, there is a tendency to make everything in sight an extern variable because it appears to simplify \\ncommunications - argument lists are short and variables are always there when you want them. But external variables are always there even when you don't want them. Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious - variables can be changed in unexpected and even inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to modify. The second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate. \\nAt this point we have covered what might be called the conventional core of C. With this handful of building \\nblocks, it's possible to write useful programs of considerable size, and it would probably be a good idea if you paused long enough to do so. These exercises suggest programs of somewhat greater complexity than the ones earlier in this chapter. \\nExercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to \\nthe next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? \\nExercise 1-21. Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks \\nto achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab. When either a tab or a single blank would \\nsuffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference? \\nExercise 1-22. Write a program to ``fold'' long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank \\ncharacter that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column. \\nExercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings \\nand character constants properly. C comments don't nest. \\nExercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unmatched parentheses, \\nbrackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments.
