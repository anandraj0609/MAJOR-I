Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.
1.5.4 Word Counting
The fourth in our series of useful programs counts lines, words, and characters, with the loose definition that a word is any sequence of characters that does not contain a blank, tab or newline. 
This is a bare-bones version of the UNIX program wc. 
Every time the program encounters the first character of a word, it counts one more word. 
The variable state records whether the program is currently in a word or not; initially it is ``not in a word'', which is assigned the value OUT. 
We prefer the symbolic constants IN and OUT to the literal values 1 and 0 because they make the program more readable. 
In a program as tiny as this, it makes little difference, but in larger programs, the increase in clarity is well worth the modest extra effort to write it this way from the beginning.
You'll also find that it's easier to make extensive changes in programs where magic numbers appear only as symbolic constants.
