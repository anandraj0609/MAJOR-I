Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

sets all three variables to zero. 
This is not a special case, but a consequence of the fact that an assignment is an expression with the value and assignments associated from right to left. 
It's as if we had written 
   nl = (nw = (nc = 0));
The operator || means OR, so the line 
   if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
says ``if c is a blank or c is a newline or c is a tab''. (Recall that the escape sequence \t is a visible representation of the tab character.) 
There is a corresponding operator && for AND; its precedence is just higher than ||. 
Expressions connected by && or || are evaluated left to right, and it is guaranteed that evaluation will stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known. 
If c is a blank, there is no need to test whether it is a newline or tab, so these tests are not made.
This isn't particularly important here, but is significant in more complicated situations, as we will soon see. 
The example also shows an else, which specifies an alternative action if the condition part of an if statement is false. 
The general form is 
   if (expression)
       statement
1
   else       statement
2
One and only one of the two statements associated with an if-else is performed.
If the expression is true, statement1 is executed; if not, statement2 is executed. 
Each statement can be a single statement or several in braces. 
In the word count program, the one after the else is an if that controls two statements in braces. 
Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any? 
Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line. 

1.6 Arrays
Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space characters (blank, tab, newline), and of all other characters.
This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program. 
There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array to hold the number of occurrences of each digit, rather than ten individual variables. 
Here is one version of the program:
