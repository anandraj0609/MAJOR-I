   /* count digits, white space, others */
  
The output of this program on itself is 
   digits = 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, white space = 123, other = 345
The declaration 
   int ndigit[10];
declares ndigit to be an array of 10 integers.
Array subscripts always start at zero in C, so the elements are ndigit[0], ndigit[1], ..., ndigit[9]. 
This is reflected in the for loops that initialize and print the array. 
A subscript can be any integer expression, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants. 
This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits. For example, the test 
   if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
determines whether the character in c is a digit. 
If it is, the numeric value of that digit is 
   c - '0'
