1.9 Character Arrays
The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. 
To illustrate the use of character arrays and functions to manipulate them, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. 
The outline is simple enough: 
   while (there's another line)
       if (it's longer than the previous longest)           (save it)           (save its length)   print longest line
This outline makes it clear that the program divides naturally into pieces. 
One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process. 
Since things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too. 
Accordingly, let us first write a separate function getline to fetch the next line of input. 
We will try to make the function useful in other contexts.
At the minimum, getline has to return a signal about possible end of file; a more useful design would be to return the 
length of the line, or zero if end of file is encountered. 
Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid line length. 
Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing only a newline has length 1. 
When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. 
This suggests a second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. 
Finally, we need a main program to control getline and copy. Here is the result.
