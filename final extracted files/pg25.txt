Chapter 1
The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program, which we assume is contained in one file. 
main and getline communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the arguments are declared by the line 
   int getline(char s[], int lim);
which specifies that the first argument, s, is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. 
The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside storage.
The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. 
getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. 
This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. 
Some functions return a useful value; others, like copy, are used only for their effect and return no value. 
The return type of copy is void, which states explicitly that no value is returned. 
getline puts the character '\0' (the null character, whose value is zero) at the end of the array it is creating, to
