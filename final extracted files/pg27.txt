Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. ( Chapter 4 discusses the static storage class, in which local variables do retain their values between calls.) 
Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. 
If they are not set, they will contain garbage. 
As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions, that is, variables that can be accessed by name by any function. (This mechanism is rather like Fortran COMMON or Pascal variables declared in the outermost block.) 
Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions.
Furthermore, because external variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned. 
An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside storage for it. 
The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable. 
The declaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be implicit from context. 
To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. 
This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions.
