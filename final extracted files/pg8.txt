Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
     
This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float and the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. 
We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. 
A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values. 
If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. 
If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. 
If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted to floating point. 
Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers. 
The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in Chapter 2. 
For now, notice that the 
assignment 
   fahr = lower;
and the test 
   while (fahr <= upper)
also work in the natural way - the int is converted to float before the operation is done. 
The printf conversion specification %3.0f says that a floating-point number (here fahr) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. 
%6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. 
The output looks 
like this: 
     0   -17.8
    20    -6.7    40     4.4   ...
Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: %6f says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; %.2f specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and %f merely says to print the number as floating point.
