once done is , before the loop proper entered is . The second part the test or condition is that the loop controls :
This condition evaluated is ; if it true is , the loop -LRB- here a single ptintf -RRB- of the body executed . Then the is
increment step
executed is , and the condition re-evaluated . The loop terminates if the condition false become has . the As with
while , the loop of the body a single statement or braces . The in enclosed statements of a group be can

while between The choice and for , which The for usually appropriate is clearer . seems on based arbitrary is
loops in which the initialization and increment single statements are for and logically related , since it more is
while and it than compact the loop statements together one place in control keeps .

1.4 Symbolic Constants
magic numbers with A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever . It bad practice a program in `` magic numbers '' 300 and 20 like bury to 's ; they someone who the program later read to have might to little information convey , and they a systematic way in change to hard are . deal to One way them meaningful give to is

#define name replacement list
Thereafter , name -LRB- quotes and another name of not part not in -RRB- of any occurrence the by replaced be will
corresponding replacement text . The name the same form a variable name as : a sequence letters and digits of that a letter with begins . has The replacement text characters of any sequence be can ; it numbers to limited not is .
