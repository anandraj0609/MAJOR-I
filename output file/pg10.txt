is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the loop: 
This condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body of the loop (here a single ptintf) is executed. Then the 
increment step 
is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates if the condition has become false. As with the 
while, the body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The 
initialization, condition and increment can be any expressions. 
The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate 
for loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related, since it is more 
compact than while and it keeps the loop control statements together in one place. 
Exercise 1-5. Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 
degrees to 0. 

1.4 Symbolic Constants
A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever. It's bad practice to bury ``magic numbers'' like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey little information to someone who might have to read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. One way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful 
names. A #define line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters: 
  #define name replacement list 
Thereafter, any occurrence of name (not in quotes and not part of another name) will be replaced by the 
corresponding replacement text. The name has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a letter. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.
