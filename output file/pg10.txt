Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
once done is , before the loop proper entered is .
The second part the test or condition is that the loop controls :
This condition evaluated is ; if it true is , the loop -LRB- here a single ptintf -RRB- of the body executed is .
Then the increment step executed is , and the condition re-evaluated .
The loop terminates if the condition false become has .
the while with As , the loop of the body a single statement or braces in enclosed statements of a group be can .
The initialization , condition and increment any expressions be can .
and for while between The choice , which clearer seems on based arbitrary is .
The for usually , since it while than more compact is and it the loop statements together one place in control keeps loops in which the initialization and increment single statements are for appropriate and logically related is .
Exercise 1-5 . the temperature conversion program reverse order in the table print to , that is , 300 from Modify
degrees 0 to .
1.4 Symbolic Constants
we before A final observation temperature conversion forever leave .
It bad practice a program in `` magic numbers '' 300 and 20 like bury to 's ; they someone who the program later read to have might to little information convey , and they a systematic way in change to hard are .
magic numbers with deal to One way them meaningful names give to is .
A #define line a symbolic name or symbolic constant characters of a particular string be to defines :
#define name replacement list
Thereafter , name -LRB- quotes and another name of not part not in -RRB- of any occurrence the corresponding replacement text by replaced be will .
The name a variable name as the same form : a sequence letters and digits of that a letter with begins has .
The replacement text characters of any sequence be can ; it numbers to limited not is .
