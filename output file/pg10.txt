Exercise 1-5 . the table in reverse order , that is , Modify from 300 to print the temperature conversion program

1.4 Symbolic Constants
A final observation before we temperature conversion forever leave . It bad practice `` magic numbers '' in a program 's to bury like 300 and 20 ; they someone who the program later little information convey to might have to read , and hard to change in a systematic way are they . One way them meaningful to deal with magic numbers is to give
A #define line a symbolic name or a particular string of symbolic constant characters defines to be names . :
#define name replacement list
Thereafter , any occurrence the by of name -LRB- not part not in of quotes and another name -RRB- will be replaced
corresponding replacement text . The name the same form a variable name as : a sequence letters and digits of that a letter with begins . any sequence of text characters can be The replacement has ; it limited to numbers not is .
