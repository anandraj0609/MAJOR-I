Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
LOWER , UPPER and STEP constants symbolic , not variables are , so they not The quantities do appear in
declarations . in written so they readily ber can Symbolic constant names are conventionally upper case
from . names lower case variable Notice distinguished that there no semicolon at the end of a #define line is .
1.5 Character Input and Output
We related programs processing character data . You that many find a family of will are going to consider for
programs just versions of the prototypes expanded that we here are discuss .
regardless of The model input and output supported very simple by the standard library of . Text input or output , is
where it originates or where it to goes , characters as streams with . of dealt a sequence of divided characters into stream lines is A text is ; each line zero or followed by a newline character consists of more characters . It the library each input or output stream this model to make confirm is the responsibility ; the C programmer using how the program outside represented lines need not worry about are the library of .
The standard library or one character a time at , which several functions for reading of getchar provides writing
and it called is , the next input character from a text stream reads getchar putchar are the simplest . Each time
and That is , after as its value . returns that
the variable c the next character of input contains . normally the keyboard The characters ; input from come from
discussed in files is
Chapter 7 .
The function each time prints it called is a character putchar :
c as the contents of the integer variable on a character , usually the screen . Calls to putchar and printf prints
interleaved may be ; the order in which the calls made appear will in are the output .
1.5.1 File Copying
getchar and putchar , you a surprising amount anything of useful code Given write can input and output . more about without a program is that its output one its input copies at a time to character The simplest example knowing :
a character read
