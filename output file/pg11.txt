 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
LOWER , UPPER and STEP symbolic constants , not variables are , so they appear in not do The quantities
declarations . conventionally upper case in written so they readily ber can are Symbolic constant names
lower case variable names from . distinguished Notice that there a #define line of the end at no semicolon is .
1.5 Character Input and Output
We related programs processing character data . for You that many find will of a family consider to going are
programs just the prototypes of versions expanded that we here discuss are .
The model input and output of the standard library by supported very simple . Text input or output , of regardless is
where it originates or where it goes to , characters of as streams with . dealt is A text stream lines into divided characters of a sequence is ; each line zero or a newline character by followed more characters of consists . It the library each input or output stream this model confirm make to of the responsibility is ; the library using the C programmer how lines the program outside represented are about worry not need .
The standard library or writing one character a time at , which getchar of reading for several functions provides
and the simplest . Each time it called is , getchar a text stream from the next input character reads are putchar
and that its value . as That is , after returns
the variable c contains input of the next character . normally the keyboard from come The characters ; input from
files in discussed is
Chapter 7 .
The function putchar a character each time prints it called is :
c as a character , usually the screen . on the integer variable of the contents prints putchar and printf to Calls
interleaved be may ; the output the order in which the calls made are in appear will .
1.5.1 File Copying
getchar and putchar , you Given useful code of a surprising amount anything knowing without write can input and output about more . The simplest example a program is that its output one character to a time at its input copies :
a character read
