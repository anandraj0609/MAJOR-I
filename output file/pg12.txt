The relational operator ! means `` not equal to '' = . What the keyboard or screen on a character be to appears internally as just stored , everything else like , course of is
a bit pattern . The type char specifically such character data storing for meant is , but any integer type used be can . We a subtle but important reason for int used .
The problem input valid data . from The solution is that getchar a distinctive returns of the end distinguishing is
value when there no more input , a value that any real character with confused be not can . This value is called is
EOF , `` file '' of end for . We c a type any value that getchar returns . We char use since c any possible char to addition in EOF hold to enough big be must n't ca . hold to enough big be to Therefore declare must we int use .
EOF <stdio.h> in defined an integer is , but the specific numeric value as it the same as not is long as matter n't does
any char value . the symbolic constant using By , we assured are that the program in nothing the on depends
specific numeric value .
copying for The program more concisely experienced C programmers . by C , any assignment , In written be would
such as 
an expression is and a value has , which the left hand side of the value after the assignment . is This means that a
assignment appear can a larger expression of part . as If c to a character of the assignment a while loop of the test part inside put is , the copy program this way written be can :
