Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
The relational operator = means `` not equal to '' ! .
What the keyboard or screen on a character course of is be to appears , everything else like , internally just a bit pattern as stored .
The type char specifically such character data storing for meant is , but any integer type used be can . We a subtle but important reason for int used .
The problem input of the end valid data from distinguishing is .
The solution is that getchar a distinctive value returns when there no more input , a value that any real character with confused be not can is .
This value EOF , `` file of end '' for called is .
We c a type any value hold that getchar returns to enough big be to declare must .
We char use since c any possible char to addition in EOF hold to enough big be must n't ca .
Therefore we int use .
EOF <stdio.h> in defined an integer is , but the specific numeric value as it the same any char value as not is long as matter n't does .
the symbolic constant using By , we assured are that the program in nothing the specific numeric value on depends .
copying for The program more concisely experienced C programmers by written be would .
C In , any assignment , such as an expression is and a value has , which the assignment after the left hand side of the value is .
This means that a assignment a larger expression of part as appear can .
If c to a character of the assignment a while loop of the test part inside put is , the copy program this way written be can :
