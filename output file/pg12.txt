Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
The relational operator ! `` not equal '' = . What a character on the keyboard or screen internally appears to be to as just stored , everything else like , course of is means
a bit pattern . The type specifically storing for meant is such character data char , but int for can be used any integer type . We a subtle but important reason used .
The solution from The problem input valid data . is that the end distinguishing of a distinctive returns getchar is
value when no there more input , a value that confused with any real character can not be . This value called is is
EOF , end for of `` file '' . We c a type any value that getchar returns . We char use since c EOF in addition to any possible char big enough be to hold ca n't must . big enough Therefore must declare to be to hold we use int .
EOF <stdio.h> in defined an integer is , but the specific numeric value as it the same not as long matter as is n't does
any char value . the symbolic constant By , we assured are that nothing in the program the on depends using
specific numeric value .
The program for copying more concisely experienced C programmers . C , any assignment , by would be written In
such as 
an expression is and a value has , which the value of the left hand side after the assignment . that a means This is
assignment appear can a larger expression part . of as If the assignment of a character the test part of a while loop inside put to c is , the copy written this way program can be :
