 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
a character gets The while , it c , and then tests whether the character the end-of-file signal was . If it to assigns
not was , the while of the body , the character . The while then repeats . When the input of the end finally reached is printing executed is , the while terminates and so main does .
This version the input - there now getchar to only one reference is - and the program shrinks . centralizes The
resulting program more compact is , and , once the idiom , read to easier mastered is . You this style often see 'll . -LRB- It , however carried away get and impenetrable code create to possible 's , a tendency that we curb to try will . -RRB-
