Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
The while a character gets , c to it assigns , and then tests whether the character the end-of-file signal was .
If it not was , the while of the body , the character printing executed is .
The while then repeats .
When the input of the end finally reached is , the while terminates and so main does .
This version the input centralizes - there now getchar to only one reference is - and the program shrinks .
The resulting program more compact , and , once the idiom mastered is , easier read to is .
You this style often . see 'll -LRB- It carried away get and impenetrable code , however , a tendency that we curb to try will create to possible 's . -RRB-
the assignment , the condition within around The parentheses necessary are .
! = of The precedence that = of , which means that parentheses the relational test of the absence ! in = the assignment = before done be would than higher is .
So the statement 0 or 1 to c setting of the undesired effect , on depending has This to equivalent is whether or not getchar of the call Chapter 2 in file . -LRB- this on More of end returned . -RRB-
Exercsise 1-6 . Verify that the expression -LRB- -RRB- ! = EOF getchar 0 or 1 is .
Exercise 1-7 . a program EOF of the value print to Write .
1.5.2 Character Counting
The next program characters counts ; it the copy program to similar is .
