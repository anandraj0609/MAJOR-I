 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
The statement
+ + nc ;
presents a new operator , + + , which means one by increment . You instead nc = nc + 1 write could but + + nc is
more concise and often more efficient . There a corresponding operator -- 1 . The operators + + and by decrement to -- either prefix operators -LRB- + + nc -RRB- or postfix operators -LRB- nc + + -RRB- be can is ; these two forms expressions in different values have , as in shown be will
Chapter 2 , but + + nc and nc + + both increment nc . the moment For we will will
the prefix form to stick .
The character counting program accumulates an int . long integers instead of a long variable in its count at are
32 least bits . Although some machines on , int and long the same size are , others on an int 16 bits , 32767 of a maximum value with , is and it relatively little input overflow an int counter to take would . The conversion specification % ld printf tells that the corresponding argument a long integer is .
It even bigger numbers with cope to possible a double -LRB- double precision float -RRB- using . by be may We also will
a while instead of statement for a , another way the loop write to illustrate to use .
uses % printf f for both float and double ; % .0 f the decimal point and the of the printing suppresses
fraction part , which zero is .
loop for this of The body empty is , because all the work the test and increment parts . But the in done is
C of grammatical rules require that statement for a a body . The isolated semicolon , a null statement called , have
is there that requirement satisfy to . We it a separate line on it visible make to put .
Before we no characters , the while or contains the input if that observe , the character counting program leave
for test getchar to the very first call on fails , and the program zero , answer . This important is the right . while about the nice things of One produces and for is that they proceeding before , the loop of the top at test
the body . with If there nothing do to is , nothing done is , even if that never the loop body through going means .
Programs intelligently when zero-length input given . The while act and statements help for ensure that should
