Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
programs boundary conditions with reasonable things do .
1.5.3 Line Counting
The next program input lines counts .
As we above mentioned , the standard library ensures that an input text stream lines of a sequence as appears , each a newline by terminated .
Hence , counting lines just newlines counting is :
the while of The body now an if of consists , which turn in the increment + + nl controls .
The if statement the parenthesized condition tests , and if the condition true is , the statement -LRB- or braces in statements of group -RRB- that follows executes .
We again show what by what controlled is to indented have .
The double equals sign = = the C notation `` equal to is '' for -LRB- Pascal 's single = or Fortran 's . EQ . like -RRB- is .
This symbol the equality test the single = from distinguish that C assignment for uses to used is .
caution : C to newcomers of A word occasionally = write when they = = mean .
As we Chapter 2 in see will , the result usually a legal expression is , so you no warning get will .
written between single quotes A character an integer value the machine 's character set in the character of the numerical value to equal represents .
This a character constant called is , although it just another way a small integer write to is .
So , example for , ` A ' a character constant is ; the ASCII character in set its value 65 , the character A. of the internal representation is
course Of , ` A ' 65 over preferred be to is : its meaning obvious is , and it set a particular character of independent is .
string constants in used The escape sequences also character constants in legal are , so ' the newline character , which ASCII in 10 is of the value for n ' stands \ .
You that carefully ' \ n ' a single character is , and in expressions just an integer is ; the other hand on note should , ' \ n ' a string constant is that only one character contain to happens .
strings versus characters of The topic further Chapter 2 in discussed is .
Exercise 1-8 . a program blanks , tabs , and newlines count to Write .
Exercise 1-9 . a program its input its output to , a single blank by one or more blanks of each string replacing copy to Write .
