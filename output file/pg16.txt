a program its input its output to , each tab replacing \ t , each backspace by \ by b copy , and each \ \ by backslash . This to Exercise 1-10 . Write tabs and backspaces an unambiguous way in visible makes .
1.5.4 Word Counting
useful programs of our series in The fourth lines , words , and characters , the loose definition with counts that a word characters of any sequence is that a blank , tab or newline contain not does .
This the UNIX program wc of a bare-bones version is .
Every time the program a word of the first character encounters , it one more word counts .
The variable state records whether the program currently a word in is or not ; initially it `` not a word in '' , which the value OUT assigned is is .
We and the literal values to OUT 1 and 0 IN the symbolic constants prefer because they the program more readable make .
this as tiny as a program In , it little difference makes , but larger programs in , clarity in the increase the modest extra effort it the beginning from this way write to well worth is .
You also find that it programs in extensive changes make to where magic numbers only symbolic constants as appear easier 's 'll .
