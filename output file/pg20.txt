 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
Exercise 1-13 . a program its input in words of the lengths of a histogram print to Write .
It the bars horizontal with the histogram draw to easy is ; a vertical orientation more challenging is .
Exercise 1-14 . a program its input in different characters of the frequencies of a histogram print to Write .
1.7 Functions
C In , a function Fortran in a subroutine or function , or Pascal in a procedure or function to equivalent is .
A function a convenient way some computation encapsulate , which its implementation about worrying without used be then can to provides .
properly designed functions With , it ignore how a job done is to possible is ; knowing what done is sufficient is .
C functions of the sue easy , convinient and efficient makes ; you often and called once only , just because it code of some piece clarifies defined a short function see will .
far So we printf , getchar and putchar like only functions used that us for provided been have have ; now it time our own of a few write to 's .
Since C Fortran of the \*\* like no exponentiation operator has , let us a function power -LRB- m , n -RRB- a positive integer power n. to an integer m raise to writing by function definition of the mechanics illustrate
That is , power -LRB- 2,5 -RRB- of the value 32 is .
This function a practical exponentiation routine , it since not is
handles small integers , but illustration for it 's good enough . of -LRB- The standard library a function pow -LRB- x , y -RRB- that xy computes contains . -RRB- only positive powers
Here the function power and a main program it exercise to is , so you the whole structure once at see can .
