1.9 Character Arrays
C in array of The most common type characters of the array is .
character arrays and functions of the use them manipulate to , let illustrate To a program write that text lines of a set reads and the longest prints 's .
The outline simple enough is :
while -LRB- there 's another line -RRB-
if -LRB- it longer 's than the previous longest -RRB- -LRB- it save -RRB- -LRB- its length save -RRB- longest line print
This outline it clear that the program naturally pieces into divides makes .
One piece a new line gets , another it saves , and the rest the process controls .
Since things nicely so divide , it well them that way too write to be would .
Accordingly , us first a separate function getline input of the next line fetch to write let .
We the function other contexts in useful make to try will .
the minimum At , getline file of possible end about a signal return to has ; a more useful design the return to be would
the line of length , or zero if end file of encountered is .
Zero an acceptable end-of-file return is because it never a valid line length is .
Every text line at least one character has ; only a newline containing even a line length 1 has .
When we a line find that than longer the previous longest line is , it somewhere saved be must .
This a second function , copy , a safe place to the new line copy to suggests .
Finally , we need control getline and copy . to a main program Here the result is .
