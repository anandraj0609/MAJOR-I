The functions getline and copy the program , which we assume one file in contained is of the beginning at declared are .
main and getline communicate arguments and a returned value of a pair . through getline In , the arguments the line by declared are
int getline -LRB- char s -LRB- -RRB- , int lim -RRB- ;
which specifies that the first argument , s , an array is , and the second , lim , an integer is .
a declaration in an array of the size supplying of The purpose storage set aside to is .
an array s of The length since its size main in set is getline in necessary not is .
getline uses a value the caller to back , just as the function power did send to return .
This line also declares that getline an int returns ; since int the default return type is , it omitted be could .
Some functions a useful value return ; others , copy like , only their effect for used and return no value are .
copy of The return type void is , which explicitly states that no value returned is .
getline the array of the end it , to creating is at the character ' \ 0 ' -LRB- the null character , whose value zero is -RRB- puts
