 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
automatic henceforth these local variables to . refer to -LRB- Chapter 4 the static storage class , in which local variables their values calls between retain do discusses . -RRB-
Because automatic variables and go function invocation with come , they one call from the next to their values retain not do , and explicitly each entry upon set be must .
If they set not are , they garbage contain will .
automatic variables to an alternative As , it -LRB- This mechanism is rather like Fortran COMMON or Pascal variables the outermost block in declared . -RRB- variables that all functions to external are , that is , variables that . any function by name by accessed be can define to possible is
Because external variables globally accessible are , they argument lists instead of functions between data communicate to used be can .
Furthermore , because external variables existence in permanently , and disappearing as functions and exited called are appearing rather than remain , they the functions that set them returned have after their values even retain .
An external variable , once exactly , any function of outside defined be must ; this it for storage sets aside .
The variable also each function in declared be that it access to wants must ; this the variable of the type states .
The declaration an explicit extern statement be may or context from implicit be may .

This the calls , declarations , and all three functions of bodies changing requires .
