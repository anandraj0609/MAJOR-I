Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
main , getline and copy in The external variables the example above , which their type and cause storage them for allocated be to state of the first lines by defined are .
Syntactically , external definitions just local variables of definitions like are , but since they functions of outside occur , the variables external are .
Before a function an external variable use can , the variable of the name the function to known made be must ; the declaration except the added keyword extern for before the same as is .
certain circumstances In , the extern declaration omitted be can .
If the external variable of the definition a particular function in its use before the source file in occurs , then there the function in an extern declaration for no need is .
main , getline and copy in The extern declarations thus redundant are .
fact In , common practice the source file of the beginning at all external variables of definitions place , and then all extern declarations omit to is .
If the program several source files in is , and a variable file1 in defined and file2 and file3 in used is , then extern declarations file2 and file3 in the variable of the occurrences connect to needed are .
The usual practice a separate file in variables and functions of extern declarations collect to is , historically called a header , that each source file of the front at #include by included is .
The suffix . h header names for conventional is .
The functions the standard library of , example for , <stdio.h> like headers in declared are .
This topic Chapter 4 in length , and the library itself Chapter 7 and Appendix B. in at discussed is
