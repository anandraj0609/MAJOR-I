Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
characters of this sequence print to -RCB- \ the newline character represents n
The first C program
a function of The statements braces -LCB- in enclosed are -RCB- .
The function main only one statement contains ,
printf -LRB- `` hello , world \ n '' -RRB- ;
A function it naming by called , arguments of a parenthesized list by followed , so this the argument `` hello , world \ n '' with the function printf calls is .
printf a library function is that output , this case in characters of the string the quotes between prints .
double quotes in characters of A sequence , `` hello , world \ n '' like , a character string or string constant called is .
the moment For character strings of our only use printf and other functions for arguments as be will .
the string in The sequence \ n the newline character for C notation is , which when printed the left margin to the next line on the output advances .
If you the \ n -LRB- a worthwhile experiment -RRB- leave out , you find will that there no line advance is after the output printed is .
You \ n the printf argument in a newline character include to use must ;
if you something like try
printf `` hello , world -LRB-
'' -RRB- ;
the C compiler an error message produce will .
printf never a newline character automatically supplies , so several calls stages in an output line build up to used be may .
Our first program well as just identical output produce to written been have could .
Notice that \ n only a single character represents .
\ n like An escape sequence hard-to-type or invisible characters representing for a general and extensible mechanism provides .
the others Among that C provides tab for t \ are , backspace for b , \ '' the double quote and \ \ for the backslash for \ itself .
There a complete list in is
