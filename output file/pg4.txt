Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
Exercise 1-1. Run the ``hello, world'' program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the 
program, to see what error messages you get. 
Exercise 1-2. Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument string contains \c, where c is some 
character not listed above. 
1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions
The next program uses the formula oC=(5/9)(oF-32) to print the following table of Fahrenheit temperatures and 
their centigrade or Celsius equivalents: 
   1    -17
   20   -6   40   4   60   15   80   26   100  37   120  48   140  60   160  71   180  82   200  93   220  104   240  115   260  126   280  137   300  148
The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that 
printed ``hello, world'', but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, 
declarations, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops , and formatted output.
