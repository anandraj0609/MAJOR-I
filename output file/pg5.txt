Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
     
The two lines 
  /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
      for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
are a comment, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters between /* and */ are 
ignored by the compiler; they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand. Comments may appear anywhere where a blank, tab or newline can. 
In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the function before any 
executable statements. A declaration announces the properties of variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables, such as 
    int fahr, celsius;
    int lower, upper, step;
The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point, 
i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using; 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is 
typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10
-38 and 
1038. 
C provides several other data types besides int and float, including: 
 char   character - a single byte
 short   short integer
 long   long integer
 double  double-precision floating point 
The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic 
types, pointers to them, and functions that return them, all of which we will meet in due course. 
Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the assignment statements 
    lower = 0;
    upper = 300;    step = 20;
