 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
The two lines
\/ \* Fahrenheit-Celsius table print

a comment are , which this case in explains briefly what the program does .
Any characters \/ between \* and \* \/ the compiler by ignored are ; they freely a program easier understand to make to used be may .
Comments anywhere appear may where a blank , tab or newline can .
C In , all variables declared be must before they , usually any executable statements before the function of the beginning at used are .
A declaration variables of the properties announces ; it such as , a name and variables of a list of consists
int fahr , celsius ;
int lower , upper , step ;
The type int means that listed the variables integers ; float , which floating point means with contrast by , i.e. , numbers that a fractional part have may are .
both int and float of The range you using are the machine on depends ; 16-bits ints , which -32768 and +32767 between lie , common are , as 32-bit ints are .
A float number typically a 32-bit quantity , at least six significant digits and about 10-38 and 1038 between generally magnitude with is .
C int and float besides several other data types , including provides :
char character - a single byte
short short integer
long long integer
double-precision floating point double
these objects of The size also machine-dependent is .
There also these basic types , them to pointers , and functions that them return , all of which we due course in meet will of arrays , structures and unions are .
the temperature conversion program in Computation the assignment statements with begins
= 0 lower ;
upper = 300 ; = 20 step ;
