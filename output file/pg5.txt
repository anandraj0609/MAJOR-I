C In , all variables declared be must before they , usually the function any before of the beginning at used are
executable statements . A declaration variables of the properties announces ; it such as , a name and variables of a list of consists

int lower , upper , step ;
The type int means that listed the variables ; float , which floating point means , with contrast by integers are
i.e. , numbers that a fractional part have may . both int and float of The range you using are the machine on depends ; 16-bits ints , which -32768 and +32767 between lie , common are , as A float number is 32-bit ints . are
about 10 between typically a 32-bit quantity , at least six significant digits and magnitude generally with

1038 .
C int and float besides several other data types , including provides :
char character - a single byte
short short integer
long long integer
double-precision floating point double
