Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
This the same much before as , except that fahr and celsius float and the formula for be to declared are is
conversion a more natural way . in written is We the previous version in integer because 5\/9 use to unable were
division it zero to truncate would . A decimal point in a constant indicates that it point , however , so floating is
5.0 \/ 9.0 because it two floating-point values of the ratio is truncated not is .
If an arithmetic operator integer operands has , an integer operation performed . If an arithmetic operator one has is
floating-point operand and one integer operand , however , the integer floating point the before to converted be will
operation is . done If we -LRB- fahr-32 -RRB- written had , the 32 automatically floating point to converted be would .
Nevertheless , floating-point constants explicit decimal points with writing even when they integral values have human readers for their floating-point nature emphasizes .
when integers floating point to converted are for The detailed rules in are
Chapter 2 . that the notice , now For
assignment
= lower fahr ;
and the test
while -LRB- fahr -LRB- = upper -RRB-
also the natural way in work - the int float before the operation done is to converted is .
The printf conversion specification % 3.0 f says that a floating-point number -LRB- here fahr -RRB- at printed be to is
least three characters wide , no decimal point and no fraction digits . % 6.1 f another number -LRB- celsius -RRB- that at least six characters wide , the decimal point after 1 digit with printed be to is describes . with The output looks
this : like
0 -17.8
20 -6.7 40 4.4 ...
Width and precision a specification from omitted be may : % 6f says that the number at least six characters be to is
wide ; % f the decimal point after two characters specifies , but the width constrained not is ; and % f merely says .2
floating point as the number print to .
