Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
This the same much before as , except that fahr and celsius float be to declared are and conversion for the formula a more natural way in written is is .
We 5\/9 the previous version in use because integer division it zero to truncate would to unable were .
a constant in A decimal point indicates that it point , however , so 5.0 \/ 9.0 because it two floating-point values of the ratio is truncated not is floating is .
If an arithmetic operator integer operands has , an integer operation performed is .
If an arithmetic operator one floating-point operand and one integer operand has , however , the integer floating point to converted be will before the operation done is .
If we -LRB- fahr-32 -RRB- written had , the 32 automatically floating point to converted be would .
Nevertheless , floating-point constants explicit decimal points with writing even when they integral values have human readers for their floating-point nature emphasizes .
when integers floating point to converted are for The detailed rules Chapter 2 in are .
now For , the that notice
assignment
= lower fahr ;
and the test
while -LRB- fahr -LRB- = upper -RRB-
also the natural way in work - the int float before the operation done is to converted is .
The printf conversion specification % 3.0 f says that a floating-point number -LRB- here fahr -RRB- at least three characters wide , no decimal point and no fraction digits with printed be to is .
% 6.1 f another number -LRB- celsius -RRB- that at least six characters wide , the decimal point after 1 digit with printed be to is describes .
The output looks
this : like
0 -17.8
20 -6.7 40 4.4 ...
Width and precision a specification from omitted be may : % 6f says that the number at least six characters wide be to is ; .2 f % the decimal point after two characters specifies , but the width constrained not is ; and % f merely floating point as the number print to says
