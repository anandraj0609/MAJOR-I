 Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
% d decimal integer as print
decimal integer , at least 6 characters as % 6d print wide
% f floating point as print
floating point , at least 6 characters as % 6f print wide
.2 f print floating as % point , decimal point after 2 characters
6.2 f print floating as % point , at least 6 wide and decimal point after 2
others , printf also octal for recognizes % o , % hexadecimal for x , character for c % Among , % character string and itself for % % for s .
Exercise 1-3 . Modify the temperature conversion a program Fahrenheit table to the corresponding Celsius print to Write a heading the table above . Exercise 1-4 . print to program .
1.3 statement for The
There plenty different ways of a program write for a particular task . Let a variation the temperature converter on try 's to are .
This the same answers produces , but it certainly different looks .
One major change the variables of most of the elimination is ; only fahr remains , and we it an int made have .
The lower and upper limits and the step size only as statement , itself a new construction , for the in constants and the expression that computes the Celsius temperature now a separate assignment statement instead of printf of the third argument as appears appear .
This last change a general rule of an instance is - any context where it some type of the value use to permissible is in , you that type of a more complicated expression use can .
Since printf of the third argument a floating-point value match the % 6.1 f to be must , any floating-point expression here occur can .
statement for The a loop , the while of a generalization is .
If you the earlier while to it compare , its operation clear be should .
the parentheses Within , there semicolons by separated , three parts are .
The first part , the initialization
